# Exercice
## Goal
Simulate the GMail frontend app. We can to develop some functionality like:

- Check for new email functionality to retrieve the new emails.
- Retrieve all the email, because when we get the list of emails we only receive the headers.
- Create and send a new email.
- Starred an email in order to show the importance of that email.
- Select all emails and add some operations with the selection.
- Archive an email in order to hide this email.
- Add a label to an email.

We are not going to develop the persistence and we are going to lose all the information if we reload the page.

## Limitations
There is no limitations because we can change anything on HTML, CSS and Javascript functionality.

# Server functions available
